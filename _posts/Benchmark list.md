# 3 Discrimination

### 3.1 Differential/discriminative training

Grade: A

Domains: Widely observed but unclear impact of procedural variations.

### 3.5 Positive patterning is easier than negative patterning

Description: Given a discrimination in which the compound of two stimuli (AB) leads to a different consequence than the two stimuli individually (A / B), the learner acquires the discrimination faster when the compound predicts the outcome (positive patterning) than when the compound predicts the absence of the outcome (negative patterning).

Grade: A

Domains: Widely observed but unclear impact of procedural variations.

### 3.6 Biconditional discrimination

Description: After training with intermixed presentations of stimulus compounds in which no single stimulus signals the presence or absence of the outcome but each compound predicts the presence or absence of the outcome (AB+ / BC– / CD+ / AD–), responding is higher for the compounds that predict the outcome.

Domains: Widely observed but unclear impact of procedural variations.

### 3.7 Biconditional is harder than component discrimination

Description: Discriminative responding between the outcome-present and outcome-absent trials of a biconditional discrimination (AB+ / BC– / CD+ / AD–) is slower than discriminative responding between the outcome-present and outcome-absent trials of a component discrimination that is matched for complexity but in which single stimuli signal the presence or absence of the outcome (AB+ / BC– / BC– / AD+).

Grade: A

Domains: Appetitive Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, human causal learning.

### 3.8 Simultaneous feature-positive discrimination

### 3.13 Interference by a common cue in negative patterning

### 3.14 Biconditional discriminations are harder than negative patterning

Grade: B

Domains: rats appetitive Pavlovian  conditioning and human causal learning, boundary conditions include the presence of a common cue and the CS duration.

### 3.15 Intra/extradimensional shift effects

Description: After discrimination training with CSs that differ on two perceptual dimensions, one CS predicting the US and another not, a subsequent discrimination with different CSs is facilitated if the previously predictive dimension continues to be predictive and the other one not, rather than the other way around.

Grade: B

Domains: Many species but only demonstrated in narrow experimental procedures mainly involving instrumental learning or pigeon autoshaping.

### 3.16 Transfer along a continuum (easy-to-hard effect)

Description: Discrimination training with two CSs that are highly discriminable facilitates subsequent discrimination training with CSs that are more similar to each other.

### 3.17 Feature-positive discriminations are easier than feature-negative discriminations

Grade: C

Domains: Mainly rat conditioned suppression, pigeon and human instrumental conditioning; unclear boundary conditions, and opposing results in humans.

### 3.18 Feature ambiguous occasion setting

Description: In serial discriminations, one stimulus (X) can be trained to concurrently serve as the feature in both a feature-negative discrimination (A+ / X…A–) and a feature-positive discrimination (B– / X…B+) when combined with different stimuli (A / B).

Grade: C
